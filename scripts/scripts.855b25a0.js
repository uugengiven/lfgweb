This class costs ~$100 in materials but at the end, you take home your own retro console that has multiple games installed. You will learn how to install the OS, connect to your console, copy files over and configure emulators and controls. Take home copies of Doom and Duke Nukem 3D with your console!</p> <h3>Mods</h3> <p>Using the Starcraft 2 or Dota 2 tools, learn how to build maps and mods then play your mods with other people. Learn how to start using content creation tools, triggers and different elements to build out your own perfect map or mod.</p> <h3>Servers</h3> <p>Learn how to build and maintain your own Minecraft server using Linux and Docker. Learn how to change settings, add mods and set up your server to create your own version of Minecraft.</p> </div>'),a.put("views/kickstarter.html",'<div id="fb-root"></div> <script>(function(d, s, id) {\r\n  var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];\r\n  if (d.getElementById(id)) return;\r\n  js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id;\r\n  js.src = "//connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js#xfbml=1&version=v2.4";\r\n  fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);\r\n}(document, \'script\', \'facebook-jssdk\'));</script> <script>window.twttr = (function(d, s, id) {\r\n  var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0],\r\n    t = window.twttr || {};\r\n  if (d.getElementById(id)) return t;\r\n  js = d.createElement(s);\r\n  js.id = id;\r\n  js.src = "https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js";\r\n  fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);\r\n \r\n  t._e = [];\r\n  t.ready = function(f) {\r\n    t._e.push(f);\r\n  };\r\n \r\n  return t;\r\n}(document, "script", "twitter-wjs"));</script> <div class="page-header"> <h1>{{header}}</h1> </div> <div class="row"> <div class="col-md-5"> <iframe frameborder="0" height="420" scrolling="no" src="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1689659549/looking-for-group-gaming-community-space/widget/card.html?v=2" width="220"></iframe> </div> <div class="content col-md-7"> <p>Take a quick moment to share our kickstarter info with your friends (Twitter, Facebook or both!).

Why would we combine these two? Because the cowork side can use the gaming side to take a break or borrow a PC to test out their website/game/app in a different environment. Because the gaming side can use the cowork space to hold classes, learning to build mods and maps to bring back over to the gaming computers and try out with people sitting right beside them. Because we believe that whether you are working or playing, having someone doing the same thing beside you makes it more fun.</p> <h2>Gaming</h2> <p>The larger percentage of the LFG floorplan is dedicated to gaming space. We are providing PC setups where people can come and rent time (cheap, seriously!) to play games or browse the internet. We are also providing Xbox One and PS4 setups, both individual pods and several "living room" spaces that are designed for single screen, multi-player parties. </p> <p>One of the special features of the gaming setup is the creation of custom servers for games. From Minecraft to Unreal Tournament to Chat (mattermost), LFG will host local servers to keep local stats, create local worlds and let people build their own local community. </p> <h2>Coworking</h2> <p>Coworking in Pittsburgh has been booming but there are no coworking locations in the South Hills. LFG is offering desk space for a daily or monthly rental. This includes all of the now standard coworking amenities: coffee pot and fridge, all hours access, convenient parking, conference rooms, printer, scanner, great internet access and a community of people who are friendly and willing to talk. LFG offers so much more than standard amenities, though.</p> <p>Monthly cowork members can use LAN computers during off hours to browse the internet or just take a break from work and play a few games. And by separating your work computer from break computers, members can prevent the common productivity killers like checking facebook, wandering the internet or going through imgur yet again.</p> <p>Or members can use our computers to do their work. Our productivity suite includes Office, Photoshop, Visual Studio, Inkscape and free software that will help members make their ideas a reality. We also offer server based tools for development testing, such as VMs and local web hosting.</p> </div> </div> </div>'),a.put("views/us.html",'<div class="page-header"> <h1>The LFG Team</h1> </div> <div id="teamList"></div> <script id="team-template" type="text/x-handlebars-template"><div class="row">\r\n            {{#each team}}\r\n              <div class="col-sm-6 col-md-4">\r\n                <div class="thumbnail">\r\n                  <img src="images/{{image}}" alt="{{name}}">\r\n                  <div class="caption">\r\n                    <h3>{{name}}</h3>\r\n                    <p>{{info}}</p>\r\n                  </div>\r\n                </div>\r\n              </div>\r\n            {{/each}}\r\n            </div></script> <script>var source = $("#team-template").html();\r\n            var template = Handlebars.compile(source);\r\n            var jqhxr = $.getJSON("team.txt", null)\r\n                .done(function(data){\r\n                    var html = template(data);\r\n                    $("#teamList").html(html);\r\n                });</script>')}]);
